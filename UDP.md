UDP's lack of reliability features are what gives it its strengths: speed and flexibility. A SE creating a UDP-based application can use UDP as a 'base' template and build in parts of reliability services into the application.

```
User Datagram Protocol is used for it's simplicity. The PDU of UDP is a **datagram**, which encapsulates data from the layer above into a payload and adds header information.

UDP characteristics:
- no guarantee of message delivery
- no guarantee of message delivery order
- no congestion avoidance or flow control
- no connection state tracking (**connectionless protocol**)

Benefits of UDP:
1. Connectionless provides that there is no handshake, so data can be sent immediately without a connection to be established with a receiver. 
2. No acknowledgement and retransmissions means delivery is faster. Datagrams are only sent once, one-directionally, therefore reduced latency.
3. No HOL blocking at transport layer because messages don't need to be sent in order

Through the use of the Source and Destination Port numbers, UDP provides multiplexing in the same way that [TCP](./TCP.md) does.
