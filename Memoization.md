# [Memoization](Memoization.md)
---
Memoization in computing is an optimization technique to speed up computation by "remembering" the results of an expensive function call by caching the result somewhere.

Memoization works for [Pure Functions](./Pure%20Functions.md), since pure functions always produce the same output for a given set of inputs. 

Memoization can be [useful in recursion](./A%20Common%20Sense%20Guide%20to%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms.md#Memoization) and optimize [React](./React.md) applications via the [useMemo Hook](./useMemo%20Hook.md) by reducing unnecessary re-renders. In algorithms, hash tables are often used to implement memoization as a space constraint tradeoff for reduced time complexity.  

The word is derived from *"memorandum"*, or *to be remembered.*
