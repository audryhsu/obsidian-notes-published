Hi $NAME$, 

I've been using Venmo when I go out and find it extremely convenient and also fun to use. I recently came across a Backend Engineer job opening posted on Venmo's website and started to look into it. I looked up ==Venmo's== engineering blog along with LinkedIn profiles of several ==Venmo== software engineers (including yours). It made me think "I really would like to work with these people" and Venmo as a whole seems like a great company. I'm wondering if you'd be interested in taking a few minutes to speak with me more about the Backend Engineer role listed on the website?

I recently wrapped up an open source feature flagging platform called F√°na ("flag" in Icelandic). It involved building a scalable, event-driven architecture composed of a backend Flag API service, admin dashboard, reverse proxy streaming service, and software development kits for Node.js and React apps. As one of the creators and Software Engineers working on this project, I took a lead role in building the reverse proxy Streaming API service and designing inter-component communication patterns that enabled real-time data.

I'd love to hear more about the position and interview with your team as I love everything I've been reading about $company$ and I think I could be a great fit for the opening.

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best,
Audry Hsu

When researching $company$, I was struck by the diversity of backgrounds of the profiles I came across. The more I learned about the company's values that prioritize $enter company values$ while also emphasizing strength in diversity, it made me think "I really would like to work with the people here that have built not only a successful product but also a reputation with a fantastic workplace culture".

I am a full-stack software engineer experienced with JavaScript/Node.js, Go, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, React, Docker, and AWS. However, I started in my prior consulting career in data management & forensics. Over the past two years, I committed to learning the fundamentals of programming from bottom up culminating in my most recent project F√°na, an open source feature flagging platform. 

I led a team of 4 remote engineers in architecting a scalable, event-driven system composed of a backend Flag API service, admin dashboard, reverse proxy streaming service, and software development kits for Node.js and React apps. I took a lead role in building the reverse proxy Streaming API service and designing inter-component communication patterns that enabled real-time data updates.

I'd love to hear more about the $Backend Software Engineering$ role and interview with your team as I love everything I've been reading about $company$ and I think I could be an excellent fit for the opening.

I look forward to hearing back from you.

#### SO template
I‚Äôve used Stack Overflow for as long as I‚Äôve been a developer, and I recently came across a post about the architecture of your products on Nick Craver‚Äôs blog. It made me think, ‚ÄúI really want to work with these people who care so much about what they do.‚Äù I‚Äôm super excited to hear about all the tools you have built to make developer processes more streamlined; that‚Äôs right up my alley.

At my current job I started out as a web dev, but I was constantly blocked by broken builds and the multi-step process for getting code out to production. I took it upon myself to fix this by prototyping a continuous integration system that eventually turned into the system our team still uses today. As we‚Äôve started to grow, I‚Äôm focusing a lot more of my time on monitoring systems and currently evaluating some possible solutions.

I look forward to hearing from you soon,

#### Airbyte outreach
Hi Charles, 

While researching Airbyte, I came across your profile and noticed that you also come from a non-traditional background prior to transitioning into software. I love that you came from an arts background --  albeit far from a Broadway production, I wouldn't trade my memories in musical theatre (Sweeney Todd was my favorite) for anything.

After 5 years in consulting in regulatory data management, I took the leap and spent over a year on mastering software engineering fundamentals. That provided me with the foundations to ultimately take on professional projects like F√°na, an open source feature flagging platform I recently built with three other engineers. In addition to building a scalable, event-driven architecture, I took a lead role in building the reverse proxy Streaming API service and designing the inter-component communication patterns that enabled real-time flag toggles.

I'd love to have the opportunity to interview with your team as I've really enjoyed everything I've been reading about Airbyte. I have a deep appreciation for the data challenges that Airbyte is aiming to solve from my past professional experience, and I think I could be an excellent fit for the software engineering roles on the Platform or API team.

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best,
Audry Hsu

#### Spotify
I've been a Spotify users for almost a decade, ever since I was a university student. I firmly believe that sharing music is a powerful tool for building human connection.

Hi Johnny,

I recently came across a Backend Engineer job opening posted on Spotify's website and started to look into it. I looked up LinkedIn profiles of several Spotify software engineers (including yours), and I was struck with the diversity of backgrounds of the profiles I came across. I particularly loved your story and your passion for music and teaching.  Your profile section reminded me of when I used to use floppy disks in my Windows '96 desktop. I recently saw floppy disks being used a "vintage" decor at a co-working space, so I think it's safe to say that floppy disks are making a comeback. 

I'm wondering if you'd be interested in taking a few minutes to speak with me more about the Backend Engineer role listed on the website?

#### Tidal
I believe that sharing music is a powerful tool for building human connections, and Tidal's mission to create a more sustainable model for the music industry, benefits artists and music fans alike. As a software engineer, I want to contribute my technical skills to a team that is building the platform to further that mission.

Technology is changing the financial industry. As a software engineer, I'd love to join the Afterpay team to contribute my technical skills and build the future of fintech. I believe empowering people to control their finances through flexibility and power of choice can make a real impact on their lives and financial future.

#### Square apps
Small business owners are responsible for everything.  My mother is the hardest working person I know. As a dealer for restaurant hardware, I watched her handle every aspect of keeping her business afloat-- from business development, customer support, billing, and shipping, to physically managing inventory and equipment. As a software engineer, I want to join Block's team and leverage my technical skills to help build products and services that reduce barriers for small businesses to get off the ground faster to focus on what's important to them - building their business and achieving their entrepreneurial ambitions.

#### new relic
Why do you think this person is a good match for a position at New Relic?

Authentic
- To me, part of being authentic is being humble. I believe staying humble allows us to stay open-minding and create deeper connections with others. In a team or organization, I believe that no matter what someone's background or experience level is, there is something that *they* can teach *you*.

Accountable
- If I make a mistake or misunderstood someone, I will be the first person to own up to and actively try to course correct. High functioning teams operate in high-trust environments. To me, being accountable to others is one of the best ways to build trust. 

Connected
- I strongly believe in giving others the benefit of the doubt. More often than not, interpersonal tension arises from misunderstanding or miscommunication. I focus on understanding where they are coming from and finding common ground. A united team can accomplish orders of magnitude more than isolated individuals.   

Bold
- I have a growth mind-set and am rarely satisfied with "good enough". No matter where I am in my career or personal development journey, I believe I am never done learning or improving myself. 

Passionate
In anything I do, I do it to the best of my ability because I take pride in my work product. This includes less glamorous tasks like writing thorough process documentation or stepping outside of my comfort zone. 
#### mattermost
We‚Äôre helping the world build better software by aligning teams, tools, and processes at each stage of the development lifecycle. At Mattermost, you get to work with thoughtful, talented, high-performing people and cutting-edge technologies.


#### census
Our mission is to build a single source of truth about customers, accessible across the entire business.

Census's mission resonates deeply with me. In my prior consulting career at Deloitte, I worked with many legal departments on modernizing their legal technology and operations. What stood out to me was that even the most data-mature companies with business intelligence teams faced the same problem -- they did not know how to operationalize their data effectively. By the time data was consolidated across functions for management reporting, the data was stale. When I read about operational analytics on Census's blog, I was reminded of how I witnessed these situations first-hand in the industry. As a software engineer, I want to leverage my technical skills to build solutions to tackle those very same data problems.  I would be thrilled to work at Census, a leader in data integration, to build the future generation of products that can solve organizations' most challenging data problems.

#### shopify interest
In my prior consulting career, I worked in the regulatory data management space and  consulted legal organizations on strengthening their data management programs ( e.g. forensics, data retention, and data privacy). While it was a non-technical role, I became the go-to data analyst and picked up programming experience doing spend analyses in Python/pandas (ingesting parquet files from legal systems and transforming in Jupyter notebooks). Now as a software engineer, I'm really interested in bridging the domain knowledge gained from my past experiences with my technical software skills to solve data-related challenges.

#### figma
Figma's mission resonates deeply with me. I believe that the label "creative" isn't reserved just for artists or musicians. Everyone has an inner creative, and Figma is democratizing design to give people the opportunity to manifest that on their own terms. Both in my prior career as a consultant and now as a software engineer, design and visual story telling has always been an essential component of my craft to distill complex ideas into a compelling story. 

As a user of Figma, I personally love the power and extensibility the platform gives me to share my story the way I envision it to make the greatest impact with my audience. I would be thrilled to work at Figma to build the future generation of products that empowers the inner "creative" in everyone. 
#### webflow
Empower everyone to create for the web ‚Äî and lead impactful, fulfilling lives while we do it.

Webflow's mission resonates deeply with me. I believe that the label "creative" isn't reserved just for artists or musicians. Everyone has an inner creative, and Webflow is empowering all humans, regardless of their access to or knowledge of web development, to create a digital presence that truly represents their brand and values.

Both in my prior career as a consultant and now as a software engineer, design and visual story telling has always been an essential component of my craft to distill complex ideas into a compelling story.

==What is a project or piece of work you are most proud of and why?==

I am most proud of the Fana, the open source feature flagging project that I worked on with three other engineers. This project felt like a true testament to my skills as an engineer. Engineers solve real-world problems, and that is exactly what our team did by taking a problem-centric approach. Our problem statement: how can developers deploy new features to users with confidence in spite of all the many things that can go wrong in a distributed production system? Once we came across feature flags, their flexibility, and the variety of use cases for them, we knew that we could leverage feature flags as a strategy for progressively rolling out a feature starting with a small, specific subset of users like beta testers.

Through a combination of research from sources ranging from company engineering blogs to thought leaders like Martin Fowler and even documentation for commercial platforms like LaunchDarkly, we discovered three key observations that guided our design principles:
1. Feature flagging platforms are difficult to maintain in-house without a dedicated developer team
2. Feature flagging platforms need to be flexible and easy for developers & non-developers to use
3. Many open-source feature flagging tools gate the audience targeting feature behind premium plans

We created Fana to fit this niche for developers that needed the flexibility of feature flags with audience targeting out of the box, an intuitive UI, and an easy deployment process to get up and running quickly. 

==What makes you particularly well suited for this role?==
My career and background is rooted in customer-first thinking. With 5 years of client service under my belt from my consulting days, I bring a mindset focused on building for others. Developers have high expectations of their tools. I hold myself to an extremely high standard for quality and am rarely satisfied with "good enough". While I can prioritize ruthlessly, my personality and nature has a strong inclination towards "how can I make this better than how I found it?".

==Why are you interested in Replit?==  Operating principles
Mission & my story
- emphasis on giving access and resources to underserved -- those curious but without the means
- unbounded exploration - let them play, let them imagine, create, without judgement or permission to create
- i felt that growing up, i needed permission to be a creative, or permission to be a technical person. I self-selected myself out of paths because I wasn't encouraged to explore those fields.

Replit's mission and operating principles resonates deeply with me. I went through most of my young adult life putting myself in a very small box of what was within my abilities and what was not, including my early career path. I truly believed that because I did not naturally excel at certain classes or wasn't a "techie", I was not equipped to be in STEM much less computer science. I spent many years self-selecting myself out because I felt that I needed some sort of proof or permission to be *that* "type" of a person. My fallacy was that I wasn't a "technical" person or a "creative" person, therefore I couldn't take on technical problems or create anything worthwhile. 

Fast-forward several years later after a lot of personal growth, maturity, and a full-on career transition, I learned that this type of thinking and lack of environment to freely and unabashedly experiment held me back. Replit provides this -- a platform for the curious, the shy, or the unsure, to play with code, imagine the possibilities, and create without "permission".

 I would be thrilled to work at Replit to help build the platform of where future generations, regardless of access to resources or traditional forms of "permission" like a formal CS education, can confidently code.
