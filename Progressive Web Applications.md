# [Progressive Web Applications](Progressive%20Web%20Applications.md)

Progress web apps (PWAs) were coined by Google to refer to web applications working as well as possible *on every platform* and taking advantage of the best parts of those platforms.

A PWA:
- does not sacrifice usability on a small screen
- works well in offline mode or slower internet connection
- encrypted traffic 

Create React Apps are progressive by default, however apps that use database backends will need more work to become PWA.
