### Outgoing
#### Books
[How to become CEO](https://www.amazon.com/How-Become-CEO-Rising-Organization/dp/0786864370)

Despite the title, this book is more about how to be a great employee. I like this book because it's very short and easy to read and contains many little tips that you may not realize on your own. One of the most important lessons from this book is the idea that you must manage your boss. You have to anticipate, without being told, the problems your boss and your boss's boss are facing, and solve those problems for them proactively. This book teaches you how to be a great employee, and how to do far more than simply what you're told. If you only do what you're told, then you won't get very far.¬†  
[Programming Beyond Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Beyond-Practices-More-Monkey/dp/1491943823)

It tries to tackle all the stuff that surrounds programming that we often don't talk about. This book is part of the O'Reilly Safari Online. Safari Online is included in the previously mentioned $99/year ACM membership
  
[Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280)

An incredibly powerful book about how to simultaneously work on dozens of projects. The main take away of this book is: have a system to manage all your projects without having to keep anything in your head.¬†

  
[So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124)

This book is about how to build a career with intention, as oppose to "follow your passion". It's a little "pop psychology", but don't let that put you off from the real insights here. There are some really great points about building career capital first, then cashing in that capital to build the next step. People always dream about making a big impact, but how do you get there?¬†
[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)¬†

This is a continuation of Cal Newport's first book above, except it gets into how to produce that career capital: through deep work. The first half of the book is about why deep work is important and the second half is about how. I think both halves are good, but if you're in a rush, skim the first half and read the second half.

[How to win friends and influence people](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034)

Dealing with people is the key to life, and this book outlines some strategies to deal with people. It's a very old book and full of stories. Again, I like this book because it's very easy to read, yet gives a lot of insight.  
  
[Lean From The Trenches](https://pragprog.com/book/hklean/lean-from-the-trenches)  
A lot of development teams work off of sprints, and this book goes over that process in detail. Sometimes it's called "agile" or "scrum", but whatever you call it, this book gives a practical breakdown of how a development team could organize their tasks. Note that¬† I read a free version here:¬†[https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2). I assume that this paid version is better, but if you don't want to pay, you can read the free version. Well worth the 3 or 4 hours it takes to get through this book. (Update: the paid version is also available via O'Reilly Safari Online, which is included in the aforementioned ACM membership at $99/year).  
  
[Code Complete 2](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670)  
Yes, this book is showing its age a little bit, but it's still worth having on your bookshelf to consume in doses. One reviewer compared this book to broccoli -- good for you, but you probably don't want to eat a bowl of it in one sitting.  
  
[Staff Engineer](https://staffeng.com/book): Leadership beyond the management track  
What happens after Senior Software Engineer? This book is a "battlefield report" of how to move forward on the technical track in engineering organizations. This is the newest book on this list, but I think it's an advantage to read this book early on.  
  
[Crucial Conversations  
](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second-ebook)The ability to communicate and collaborate effectively is essential as you grow into senior and staff roles. This is particularly challenging when teammates and partners have goals that conflict with yours. This book is a guide to navigating these difficult conversations.¬†

The list of interesting books can go on forever, and I've only highlighted a few that helped me early in my career. The key, I think, isn't so much about the books listed here, but to keep learning and keep growing.
#### ARTICLES
Why programmers are not paid in proportion to their productivity](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/12/23/why-programmers-are-not-paid-in-proportion-to-their-productivity/)
-   [Thread: Be likable or get fired](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16883882)
    -   The comments are the most important here, and two stand out:
        -   don't trash a system before you understand it, which takes time
        -   make your team/colleagues look good, even if you think you are better than them
-   Fun Twitter thread on¬†[What to do in your first 2 weeks at work](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1370575853554266118)
-   [Tech Leaders Reading List](https://mashable.com/2018/04/28/tech-leaders-reading-list-greg-epstein/#jG4mwJSnYsqF)¬†
    -   The article is written by Rachel Kraus, and the list of books is curated by Greg Epstein, the "Humanist Chaplain" at MIT and Harvard.¬†
    -   One of the best aspects of becoming a capable programmer is being able to leverage your new skills to make a huge impact on the world. But what if you aren't as good of a human being as you thought and your impact ends up hurting the world not necessarily through malice but through ignorance? This is the situation our industry is in today, with younger and younger tech leaders running companies that permeate our daily lives. We need more engineers with humanist ideals to ensure that we apply technology in ways that benefit humanity and society. This is arguably one of the most important post-Capstone things to work on as you grow your technical career.
-   [From Coding Bootcamp to Building Distributed Databases](https://medium.com/swlh/from-coding-bootcamp-graduate-to-building-distributed-databases-29acbb723d8)
    -   A great article about how to grow your career, both inside your company and in industry.¬†
-   [What Makes a Senior Engineer?](https://codewithstyle.info/software-vs-systems/)¬†
-   Negotiation¬†[101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qilnCGjrpso)¬†and¬†[201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ns1E9L2hk)¬†from interview.io
    -   These videos are great materials to help you during offer negotiations on your second (and third, and fourth...) job hunt. You'll notice that a lot of the advice given tracks with what Launch School recommends. Additionally, there are some more aggressive and advanced techniques that, while not being appropriate for a job hunter straight out of Capstone, could help more experienced candidates maximize their offer negotiations. You won't need these videos immediately, but keep them around for when you start job hunting again.
Cover letters can be componentized:¬†
- Write three different forms of self introduction
- Write a middle part that directly responds to line items in the job ad
- Write a few boilerplatey endings
- Play mix and match for each company, matching tone and relevance of your background to the job in question.¬†
