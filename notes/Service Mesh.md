Often used for inter-service communication in a [Microservices](../Microservices.md) architecture. 
![Service-Mesh_Team4.pdf](../images/Service-Mesh_Team4.pdf)

- each service uses a "sidecar" agent (personal assistant) to mediate traffic and communications
- otherwise, services are decentralized handle their own load balancing, end point discovery, health checks, tracing
- high degree of service independence
- 👎complex, lots of moving parts and repetitive work for each node
