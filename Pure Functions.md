# [Pure Functions](Pure%20Functions.md)
---
Pure functions do not cause any [Side Effects](./Side%20Effects.md) and have a *consistent return value* (e.g. return value is fully dependent on arguments) during the function's life time


Benefits of a pure function:
 - easy to test
 - essential in [functional programming](./Functional%20Programming.md) that relies on declarative code.

```ad-tip

It is more precise to say whether a function **call** is pure/impure or has side effects, although we may hear functions being discussed as "having/not having" side effects or "being" pure/impure. 

```
