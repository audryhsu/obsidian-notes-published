# [Flux](Flux.md)
---
Flux was the predecessor to [Redux](./Redux.md) (both developed by Facebook) to make state management easier by separating state from [React](./React.md) components into *stores* in a *unidirectional data flow*. Flux and Redux are more pattern than framework. 

There is a single dispatcher that is the central hub that manages all data flow in Flux applications. It is a registry of callbacks into stores -- its job is to distribute actions to all stores. Stores then update themselves.
