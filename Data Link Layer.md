# [Data Link Layer](Data%20Link%20Layer.md)
---
The protocols at this layer are primarily concerned with identification of devices on the physical network and moving data over the physical network between the devices (routers, switches, computers).

**Ethernet** is the most commonly used protocol at this layer, and technical specifications of ethernet cables are governed by the same IEEE standards that include the Ethernet communication protocols.
- **Ethernet frames** are a Protocol Data Unit and encapsulate data from the Internet/Network layer above.
	- An Ethernet Frame adds logical structure to the stream of bits and defines which bits are actually the data payload, and which are the metadata to be used to transport the frame.
	- Ethernet devices identify the parts in the frame because "fields" have specific lengths in bytes and appear in a set order.

##### Parts of a frame
- **Preamble and Start of Frame Delimiter (SFD)**: not part of frame, but sent just prior to notify the receiving device to expect frame data then identify the start point of that data.
- **Source and Destination MAC address**: the address of the device which created the frame and the address of the destination device.
- **Length** field indicates the size of the  data payload
- **DSAP and SSAP, Control**: DSAP and SSAP identify the network protocol used for the data payload. Control field provides info about the communication mode for the frame to facilitate flow control
- Data payload: can be between 42 and 1497 bytes in length, containing the entire PDU from the layer above
- **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**: checksum generated by device that created the frame. Receiving device uses the same algorithm to generate a FCS and compares this to the FCS in the sent frame. If they don't match, the frame is dropped.
	- Ethernet doesn't implement any retransmission functionality for dropped frames, this is the responsibility of higher level protocols

#### MAC Addresses
A **media access control (MAC) address** is the unique address assigned to hardware when manufactured (aka physical address or burned-in address). This is how networking devices like a switch can identify which is the right computer in a network to send a frame to. A switch keeps track of the MAC addresses of devices connected to it in it's MAC Address table to direct frame traffic.

This works well for local networks where everything is connected to a switch but MAC addresses don't scale well since they are tied to a specific device and are flat (address is a single sequence), hence the Internet/Network layer.
