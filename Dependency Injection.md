# [Dependency Injection](Dependency%20Injection.md)
---
Dependency injection is a [Programming](Programming.md) design pattern that in which an object is provided the dependencies it needs (declaratively), without the object having to worry about *how* to fetch/obtain that dependency.

The goal of dependency injection is to promote:
1. [separation of concerns](separation%20of%20concerns.md) since object isn't aware of how it gets its dependencies and
2.  [loose coupling](loose%20coupling.md) since the configuration of the dependency is separate from how it is used by an object

What you should be doing is stating a need, "I need something to drink with lunch," and then we will make sure you have something when you sit down to eat.
